### Bugs

## [3.0.0] - 2019-02-14

### Features

- Migrated from using `blessed` to [`neo-blessed`](https://github.com/embark-framework/neo-blessed) as the underlying terminal renderer. `neo-blessed` is a maintained fork of `blessed` and brings in some nice fixes for us. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/270
- Added Prettier to the codebase ðŸŽ‰ Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/270

### Docs

- Added a warning about deprecation of Node 6 support. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/270

### Migration Instructions

With this release we are dropping support for Node 6 altogether. `neo-blessed` requires Node [>= 8.0.0](https://github.com/embark-framework/neo-blessed/blob/master/package.json#L38), meaning all users of the dashboard will need to run it using Node 8 or above. Previous versions of `webpack-dashboard` are still compatible with Node 6.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-01-29

### Features

- Added a few example setups to make the local development experience with `webpack-dashboard` a lot easier. Users can now clone the repo, `yarn`, and `yarn dev` to get running. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/267
- Migrated to `inspectpack@4`. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/263
- Added TypeScript defitions. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/269

### Tests

- Added regression tests to fix an unknown import issue for our `format-*` utils. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/263
- Added tests for all `Dashboard` methods. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/263

### Docs
