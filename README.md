# webpack-dashboard

A CLI dashboard for your webpack dev server

### What's this all about?

When using webpack, especially for a dev server, you are probably used to seeing something like this:

That's cool, but it's mostly noise and scrolly and not super helpful. This plugin changes that. Now when you run your dev server, you basically work at NASA:

### Install

`npm install webpack-dashboard --save-dev`

### Use

***OS X Terminal.app users:*** Make sure that **View â†’ Allow Mouse Reporting** is enabled, otherwise scrolling through logs and modules won't work. If your version of Terminal.app doesn't have this feature, you may want to check out an alternative such as [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html).

First, import the plugin and add it to your webpack config, or apply it to your compiler:

```js
// Import the plugin:
var DashboardPlugin = require('webpack-dashboard/plugin');

// If you aren't using express, add it to your webpack configs plugins section:
plugins: [
    new DashboardPlugin()
]

// If you are using an express based dev server, add it with compiler.apply
compiler.apply(new DashboardPlugin());
```
If using a custom port, the port number must be included in the options object here, as well as passed using the -p flag in the call to webpack-dashboard. See how below:

```js
plugins: [
    new DashboardPlugin({ port: 3001 })
]
```

In the latest version, you can either run your app, and run `webpack-dashboard` independently (by installing with `npm install webpack-dashboard -g`) or run webpack-dashboard from your `package.json`. So if your dev server start script previously looked like:

```js
"scripts": {
    "dev": "node index.js"
}
```

You would change that to:

```js
"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack-dashboard -- node index.js"
}
```
Now you can just run your start script like normal, except now, you are awesome. Not that you weren't before. I'm just saying. More so.

#### Run it

Finally, start your server using whatever command you have set up. Either you have `npm run dev` or `npm start` pointed at `node devServer.js` or something along those lines.

Then, sit back and pretend you're an astronaut.
